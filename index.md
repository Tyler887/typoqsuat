## About
Domains are often abused by hackers, usally through typosquatting. To introduce the concept, examples of typosquatting include:
* Wrong top-level domain (e.g. `golang.com` or `golang.net` instead of the actual `golang.org`)
* Wrong spelling (e.g. the dead [`goggle.com`](typo/goggle-typo))
* Other kinds of typos (e.g. the abusive site [without any valid HTML](w3validatorlink), [`wkpedia.org`](typo/wkpedia))

This site is called *Typoqsuat* because of high amounts of these typosquatting domains.

## Warning
**Not all incorrect domains are typos.** For example, `git-hub.com` redirects to `github.com` (same for that WIP `github.co` redirect), and
`goo.gle` redirects to `www.google.com`.
