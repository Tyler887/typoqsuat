## About
Domains are very abused by hackers, usally through typosquatting. Examples of typosquatting include:
* Wrong top-level domain (e.g. `golang.com` or `golang.net` instead of `golang.org`)
* Wrong spelling (e.g. [`goggle.com`](googgle-typo))
* Some letters removed (e.g. the abusive site [without any valid HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwkpedia.org%2F), [`wkpedia.org`](wkpedia))

This site is called *Typoqsuat* because of high amounts of typosquatting domains.
